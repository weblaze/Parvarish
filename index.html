        <p>
          The concept of daycares is very prevalent in the west and not so much in our country, but 
          now when we are moving from joint families to nuclear families and both the parents are 
          working we feel the need too. We at PARVARISH aim to aid you in that,<b><i> want to make the 
          parents aware about the advantages of daycares</i></b> and how their children can still be taken 
          care of while they themselves are at the office trying to give their children the best life 
          they can. It is true that <B><i>nothing can replace the love of parents but we assure you that 
          we will provide you the second best thing to it</i></B> and make sure that you don't have to 
          worry about their <b><i>safety and convenience</i></b>.

        <p>
          According to a recent survey 62.3% families in India have both parents working, 
          of these parents are in need of a decent day-care facility and have to tour
          the entire town comparing various day-cares which leads to unwanted stress 
          and wastage of resources. We at PARVARISH aim to solve that problem by 
          providing parents a platform to view, compare and book day-care facilities 
          at one place that too at costs less than market price.

        <p>
          We are a service like no other. The option to view, compare and book day care facilities
          at one place is very comfortable for any working parents and comes off as THE perfect solution.
          The great personal customer service which we will provide to the customers would be a major source of attraction.
          The experience of the founders in the respective fields along with the zeal to
          do well benefits the company as well. As of yet, there is no other website or app that is doing 
          things how we plan to do. Our motto 'A Second Home' very well defines what we want to do with the company 
          and what kind of experience we want to provide to the customers.
